GitHub's commit requirements are designed to help developers provide clear and meaningful information when submitting code changes. This practice enhances the understanding and management of the codebase's history, fostering effective collaboration, code review, and version control. Below is an explanation of GitHub's commit requirements:

<type>(<scope>): <description>

1. **Type:**
   - `feat` (Feature): Introduces new functionalities or features.
   - `fix`: Addresses code issues, such as errors or bugs.
   - `docs`: Updates documentation content, such as README or comments.
   - `style`: Adjusts code formatting and style without affecting functionality.
   - `refactor`: Reorganizes or modifies code structure without adding features or fixing errors.
   - `test`: Adds or modifies testing code.
   - `chore`: Involves changes related to build processes, tools, or dependencies.

2. **Scope:**
   - An optional field that specifies the scope of code affected by the commit. For example, `auth` (authentication module), `ui` (user interface), `api` (API endpoints), and so on.

3. **Description:**
   - Provides a concise and clear description of the changes made in the commit.
   - The description should effectively convey the purpose of the modifications.

Examples:

- `feat(ui): Add user registration page`
- `fix(api): Resolve login logic error`
- `docs(readme): Update project documentation`
- `style(ui): Adjust button colors`

Following these requirements aids in creating an understandable and maintainable history of code changes. It helps team members track changes, collaborate effectively, conduct code reviews, and manage version releases. Additionally, adhering to these guidelines can assist in automatically generating changelogs, version numbers, and other information, thereby enhancing development efficiency and codebase quality.
